## Introduction
Healthy brain function needs healthy eyesight. The brain is our most vital organ, allowing us to live complex lives. Considering that our optic nerve connects our eyes and our brain, a healthy co-dependent relationship is necessary. By keeping our eyes healthy, we keep our brain healthy â€“ improving our overall quality of life!
In this project, I have designed a simple system called VISION PROTECTOR 2.0 using ```OpenCV, Web Camera, Streamlit & other python module``` as required in the process. Like winsound to make beep sound whenever anyone come very near to tv-screen and will stop whenever he/she backoff.

This project solves the very basic and one of the most important and  ignored  problem.
## Problem Considered
1. Sitting too close to any digital screen cause eyestrain.Children may lose interest in tasks such as reading, and old one develops irritation and tiredness.
2. Waste of energy on forgetting to turn off the tv/laptop. & Safety of the eletronics devices(tv-laptop) from child.
